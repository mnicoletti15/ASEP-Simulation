# Overview
This is a simulation of a version of the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process. This is a continuous time markov chain,
which I have implemented using discrete time steps. Definitions of this markov chain (and other relevant research surrounding this model) can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_simple_exclusion_process
and here https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08683v1.

# Run
Download the repo (clone/.zip), compile the Java `src` files, and run `Main.java`.
## Parameters
- `p`               should be in decimal form between 0 and 1 
- `number of slots` should be greater than the `number of balls`
