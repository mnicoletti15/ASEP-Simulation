This is a simulation of a version of the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process. This is a continuous time markov chain,
which I have implemented using discrete time steps. Definitions of this markov chain (and other relevant research surrounding this model) can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_simple_exclusion_process
and here https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08683v1.
In order to run the simulation, simply download the repo, compile the java src files, and run them.
The parameter "p" should be in decimal form between 0 and 1, and the "number of slots" should be greater than 
the "number of balls".
